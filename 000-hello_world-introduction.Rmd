# Introduction

*Written by Rohan Alexander.*

Welcome to the first module. In this module we focus on getting R and R Studio, and then showing you a couple of motivating examples that you'll soon have the skills to be able to write yourself.

Don't worry too much if the specifics of those examples leave you a little lost - that's normal. If you stick with it then it'll all make sense eventually.

Welcome aboard!
