The DoSS Toolkit is a collection of self-paced materials to help you learn and use R.

We all know that R is a critical part of applied statistics and data science these days, but it can have a steep learning curve and be intimidating to get started with. 

The [Department of Statistical Sciences](http://www.utstat.utoronto.ca/) (DoSS) toolkit is a free series of open source online modules by undergraduates, that their fellow students and the public can use to learn the essentials of R.
