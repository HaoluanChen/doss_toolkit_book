# (PART\*) R Marky Markdown and the Funky Docs {-}

# Introduction

*Written by Rohan Alexander.*

In this module, we are going to go through R Markdown. 

R Markdown is an incredibly powerful way of combining text and code, and you can produce html, pdf, word and many other outputs. Most of us learn it as a great way to write class assignments, but these days it's used for everything from making textbooks, websites, and is even the foundation on which these tutorials are based.
